name: "dge_analysis_edgeR"
label: "DGE Analysis with edgeR"
description: "A differential gene expression analysis using edgeR for statistical tests. As a pre-step, featureCounts is used for assigning the alignments to a genomic feature. edgeR will filter all features with not enough coverage (see chapter 2.7 - https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf). Therfore, result tables show only edgeR-filtered results."
